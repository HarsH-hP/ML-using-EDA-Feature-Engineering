# ML-using-EDA-Feature-Engineering

This project shows how to perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Feature Engineering on a dataset of laptop prices. This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. 

For EDA and Feature Engineering, it handles the extraction of information from a significant feature column and forms separate features, and based on the correlation, it evaluates the feature's significance on the target variable.

This project also handles the data-processing part where categorical variables are handled using the Label encoding method and converted to numerical data.

It also shows how to handle skewed data present target variable using the log method which leads to improving the overall model

The hyperparameter tuning is handled using the GridSearchCV method on the Random Forest ML algorithm. The final output on the MAE is approx 1.16 euros which is very negligible.
