# ML-using-EDA-Feature-Engineering

This project shows how to perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and Feature Engineering on a dataset of laptop prices. This project uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. 

For EDA and Feature Engineering, it handles extraction of information from an significant feature column and forming seperate features and based on the correlation, it evaluates feature's significance on the target variable.

This project also handles the data-processing part where categorical variables are handled using Label encoding method and converted to the numerical data.

It also shows how to handle skewed data present target variable using log method which leads to improving the overall model

The hyperparameter tuning is handled using GridSearchCV method on Random Forest ML algorithm. The final output on the MEA is approx 1.16 euros which is very negligible.
